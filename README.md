## Usage

### Please see code comments for more details

### Quick start: Train

1. Download processed dataset
   from [Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UdKI5R_yTBlV4tO5uDKcGJazg_SiTwKT/view?usp=sharing)
   , place it in '/Dataset/Packaged Pkl/'.

   Note: You can also process the java-json dataset yourself.

2. Cd to '/Code', run the following script.

```bash
    python train.py
```

### Build PKL yourself, you can customize the extra edges

1. Ensure there is a result file generated.

2. Cd to '/Code', run the following script.

```bash
    python code_dataset.py
```
